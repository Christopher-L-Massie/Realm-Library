# Dedication #

This project is dedicated to those on Deviate Delight(RPPVP) who made the world feel more alive than any game I've ever played.
May their stories be told for generations. The idea for this project branched off from wanting to keep track of the stories told on that server. A future expansion to this project will be more suited to that original intention.
