# RealmLibrary#


#Overview#

Realm Library is an easy way for those who enjoy role playing to keep track of their characters and stories collaboratively.

This project was built with World of Warcraft Roleplaying inmind but the code will be built in a way so that it can be easily tweaked
to allow for other worlds to take advantage of the collaborative story writing if they wish.


#Features#

-Create Character Pages that have a biography section and another section to browse stories they feature in

-Create Stories that get placed into a timeline and other categories to easily view the events of the world over time

-Allow for Story archs to be made that can contain multiple stories

-Allow for various levels of edit privelage so that more trusted scribes can work freely.


#Dedication#

This project is dedicated to those on Deviate Delight(RPPVP) who made the world feel more alive than any game I've ever played.
May their stories be told for generations.
